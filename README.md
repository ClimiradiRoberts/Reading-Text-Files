# Reading-Text-Files

I completed the function “read_file_content” which accepts a filename as an argument and reads the text contained in that file and in turn, returns a string.

I also completed the function “count_words” which uses “read_file_content” to read the text contained in “story.txt” and in turn, returns a dictionary whose keys are unique words, and their values are the count of those words in the text e.g {“as”:10, “would”:5}.
